Szl is a tiny terminal interface for chatting with llms for linux / macOS. It offers some nice improvements to the user interface for python-tgpt and offers simple local chat management. As of today, it depends on three main packages:
1. python-tgpt (See https://github.com/Simatwa/python-tgpt ) [version 0.3.2]
2. fzf [version 0.44.1]
3. coreutils
Run using `zsh szl.sh`
Feel free to report bugs and raise issues.
