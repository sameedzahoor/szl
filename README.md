szl is a tiny terminal interface for chatting with llms. It offers some nice improvements to the user interface for python-tgpt and offers simple chat management. As of today it depends on two main packages in addition to GNU core tools:
1. python-tgpt (See https://github.com/Simatwa/python-tgpt ) [version 0.2.2]
2. fzf [version 0.44.1]
